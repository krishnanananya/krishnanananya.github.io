title: "About Me"
---

I'm a first year Master's student at Stanford University studying Statistics and Data Science. I completed my undergrad at Carnegie Mellon University with a dual degree in Economics and Statistics then spent the next 2 years working at hedge fund Bridgewater Associates as a Portfolio Associate.

My interests lie broadly in the quantitative trading, portfolio management, causal inference, and network science.
