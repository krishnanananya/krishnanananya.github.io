I'm a first year Master's student at Stanford University studying Statistics and Data Science. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2021 with a B.S. in Economics and Statistics and then spent the next 2 years working at hedge fund Bridgewater Associates as a Portfolio Associate.

My interests lie broadly in the quantitative trading, portfolio management, causal inference, and network science.
